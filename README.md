# JumpGame v0.1

My first game rebuild from Vanilla JS into Vue.js

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

If you get `TypeError: this.getOptions is not a function`, then change the version of your sass-loader into `sass-loader@10.1.1` via `package.json`, since Vue.js v2 do not support `sass-loader@11`

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
